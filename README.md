## Somethings about me:
#### My name is Irina, I'm 19 years old and my English is not that good...
#### By education I am a teacher of German, with level B2, but I became interested in another "language". And now for a little over 5 months I have been learning JavaScript! 
#### Of my strengths, I can single out perseverance and diligence - which allows me not to quit my studies, even when it is very difficult! I am also an open, active and very sociable person.
#### I am ready to learn and learn new things, because I want to be useful!

## About [this][https://irynakrt.github.io/cars-hw/] project:
#### This project was created by me during an intensive course at Itology-school! I am very glad that during this time I was able to strengthen my knowledge in layout and design, and also got acquainted with the Angular framework - a rather complex, but very useful development tool!
